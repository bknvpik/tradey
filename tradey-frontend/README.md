## Installation and Setup Instructions

Installation:

`yarn install`   

To Start Server:

You need to start backend first, go to tradey-backend folder and type:

`yarn start`

Then return to tradey-frontend folder and type: `yarn start` again.
You ran backend on port :3000, so node will ask you whether you want to run frontend server on another port, you need to accept.
Then by default frontend server will start on port :3001.

To Visit App:

`localhost:3001`
